          I first began hacking on computers when I was 12. I installed linux on my computer because I wanted it to run faster. Since then I've created software that has competed in the Nasa rover competition, built immersive games, fullstack services, android apps, and reached millions of users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like writing code that people use. I realized that best application that sits on my hard drive means nothing to me. This is why I care about customer feedback, deadlines, and project vision.
